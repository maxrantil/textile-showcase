# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation that has been superseded by more recent comprehensive documents but is preserved for historical context and development progression tracking.

## Archive Structure

### Phase 2B Progression Archive

- Contains intermediate completion documents that show the progression from TDD GREEN → REFACTOR phases
- **Current Active Docs**: All Phase 2B completion information is now in `PHASE-2B-DAY5-REFACTOR-COMPLETION-2025-09-19.md`

## Usage

Archived documents are maintained for:

- Historical reference and development progression tracking
- Debugging and understanding implementation evolution
- Compliance with documentation retention requirements

**For current information**: Always refer to non-archived documents in the main implementation directory.
