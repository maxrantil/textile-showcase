        # Strategic 3-browser CI selection (full 8-browser suite tested locally)
        # Desktop Chrome: 65% market share, Chromium engine - Linux
        # Mobile Chrome: 40% mobile market share, touch interactions - Linux
        # Safari Smoke: 20% market share, WebKit rendering - Ubuntu (WebKit) - OPTIMIZED SUBSET
        #
        # Safari Smoke Tests (Issue #211 optimization - Ultra-Minimal):
        # - Previous state: Full Safari suite excluded from CI (40min timeout, 8x slower than Chrome)
        # - Investigation: Issue #209 (15+ hours) - analytics mocking, platform fixes insufficient
        # - PR #235 Discovery: Gallery loading takes >30s on Safari/WebKit (15/23 tests failed with timeouts)
        # - Root cause: Gallery dynamic import/hydration too slow for Safari (Issue #236 tracks optimization)
        # - Current strategy: Ultra-minimal smoke tests (8 tests, NO gallery, ~5-7min target)
        # - Coverage: Basic app health only (homepage, contact, navigation, JS errors)
        # - Test files: smoke-test.spec.ts ONLY (gallery tests excluded due to Safari timeout limitation)
        # - Retry optimization: 1 retry (vs 2 for Chrome) to reduce execution time
        # - Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 with WebKit (cost-effective, stable)
        # - Full Safari suite: Available for local testing on macOS (npx playwright test --project="Desktop Safari")
        # - Market coverage: 85%+ browsers (Safari has limited test coverage - basic health only)
