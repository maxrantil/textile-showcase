## 🚨 QUICK START CHECKLIST

**Before ANY work:**

1. **PRD/PDR Required?** New features/UX changes → PRD first. Approved PRDs → PDR next.
2. **GitHub Issue** (after PRD/PDR if applicable)
3. **Feature Branch** (`feat/issue-123-description`) - NEVER commit to master
4. **Agent Analysis** (see trigger rules below)
5. **TDD Cycle** (failing test → minimal code → refactor)
6. **Draft PR** (early visibility)
7. **Agent Validation** (before marking ready)
8. **Close Issue** (verify completion)

## 1. WORKFLOW ESSENTIALS

#### **PRD/PDR Workflow:**

```
💡 Feature Request/Idea
    ↓
📋 PRD Creation → 🤖 **general-purpose-agent** → ✅ Doctor Hubert Approval
    ↓
🏗️ PDR Creation → 🤖 **4 Core Agents:**
                    • architecture-designer
                    • security-validator
                    • performance-optimizer
                    • code-quality-analyzer
                 → 👨‍💻 Tech Review → ✅ Doctor Hubert Approval
    ↓
⚡ GitHub Issue Creation → Branch Creation → Implementation →
    🤖 **During Implementation:**
    • ux-accessibility-i18n-agent
    ↓
Draft PR →
    🤖 **Agent Review Checklist (MANDATORY):**
    • code-quality-analyzer
    • security-validator
    • performance-optimizer
    • ux-accessibility-i18n-agent (final check)
    • architecture-designer (if structural)
    • devops-deployment-agent (pre-deployment readiness)
    ↓
Testing → PR Ready for Review → Merge → Deployment
```

**Documents Location:**

- PRDs: `docs/implementation/PRD-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- PDRs: `docs/implementation/PDR-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### Git Workflow

**1. Planning Phase:**

- **Create GitHub issue ONLY after PRD/PDR approval** (if required)
- **Reference approved PRD/PDR documents** in issue description
- Issue describes implementation tasks, not requirements (requirements in PRD)

**2. Branch Setup:**

- **NEVER commit directly to `master`**
- Create descriptive branch: `fix/auth-timeout`, `feat/api-pagination`, `chore/ruff-fixes`
- Reference issue in branch name: `feat/issue-123-description`

**3. Development Phase:**

- **Document agent recommendations** in issue or PR description
- **Validate with secondary agents** for cross-functional concerns
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- **NEVER use `--no-verify`** to bypass hooks
- **NEVER include co-author or tool attribution** - no `Co-authored-by:`, `Generated with Claude Code`, or similar mentions in commits/PRs

**4. Review Phase:**

- **Pull requests** for all changes (draft early, ready when complete)
- Use commit/PR messages like `Fixes #123` for auto-linking
- Squash only when merging to `master`; keep granular history on feature branch

**5. Completion Phase:**

- **Verify issue closure** after PR merge

### Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **RED** - Write failing test first
2. **GREEN** - Minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve while tests pass
4. **NEVER** write production code without failing test first

**Required test types**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End (no exceptions without explicit authorization)

---

## 2. AGENT INTEGRATION

### Auto-Trigger Rules

**ALWAYS RUN FIRST (Pre-Analysis):**

- `architecture-designer` - Multi-file/system changes
- `security-validator` - Credentials, processes, network, files
- `code-quality-analyzer` - All code modifications

**CONTEXT TRIGGERS:**

- User interface mentions → `ux-accessibility-i18n-agent`
- Performance keywords (slow, optimize, timeout) → `performance-optimizer`
- Deploy/infrastructure mentions → `devops-deployment-agent`

**VALIDATION (Post-Implementation):**
All relevant agents must validate final implementation

### Time Management

- **Agent disagreements**: Escalate to Doctor Hubert if >3 agents conflict
- **Quality thresholds**: Security ≥4.0, Performance ≥3.5, Code Quality ≥4.0

### Decision Authority

**You can decide:**

- Technical implementation approaches within approved PDR
- Code structure and organization
- Test strategies and coverage

**Must ask Doctor Hubert:**

- Scope changes from original PRD/PDR
- Major architecture deviations
- Timeline extensions >1 day

### **Agent Usage Accountability**

**Doctor Hubert Enforcement Flags:**

- **"AGENT-AUDIT"**: Doctor Hubert can request full agent usage audit for any response
- **"MANDATORY-AGENTS"**: Triggers immediate agent analysis if Claude missed it
- **"CROSS-VALIDATE"**: Forces Claude to run all validation agents on current state

---

## 3. CODE STANDARDS

### Writing Principles

- Simple, maintainable solutions over clever ones
- Smallest reasonable changes
- Match surrounding code style
- **NEVER remove code comments unless provably false**
- **NEVER implement mock mode (use real data/APIs)**
- **NEVER name things 'improved', 'new', 'enhanced'** - be evergreen

### File Requirements

- All code files start with 2-line comment: `# ABOUTME: [description]`
- Evergreen comments (describe current state)
- Ask before reimplementing from scratch

### Pre-commit Hooks (MANDATORY)

- Install: `pre-commit install`
- **NEVER bypass with `--no-verify`**
- All commits must pass checks

---

## 4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

### Documentation Standards

```
project-name/
├── README.md           # Living document - update after major changes
├── CLAUDE.md           # This file
├── src/                # Source code
├── tests/              # All test files
├── docs/
│   ├── implementation/ # PRDs, PDRs, phase docs
│   └── templates/      # GitHub templates
└── config/             # Configuration files
```

- **NEVER scatter .md files in root**

### Implementation Tracking

**MANDATORY: Mark phases as complete when finished**

**After Phase Completion**: Update implementation plan AND ensure related GitHub issues are closed with reference to completed work.

### **MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

**Every phase MUST have documentation created during implementation:**

1. **Phase Documentation File**: `docs/implementation/PHASE-X-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
2. **Real-time Updates**: Document decisions, blockers, and progress as work happens
3. **Session Continuity**: Enable easy pickup between sessions
4. **Consolidation**: Merge into comprehensive docs when phase completes

**Documentation Must Include:**

- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Agent recommendations and validations
- Code changes and their impact
- Test results and coverage
- Blockers encountered and resolutions
- Next steps and dependencies

Format for active phases:

```markdown
## **PHASE X: NAME** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

_Started: Date_
_Documentation: docs/implementation/PHASE-X-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md_

### Agent Validation Status:

- [ ] Code Quality: Not started | In progress | ✅ Complete
- [ ] Security: Not started | In progress | ✅ Complete
- [ ] Performance: Not started | In progress | ✅ Complete
- [ ] Architecture: Not started | In progress | ✅ Complete

### Documentation Status:

- [ ] Phase doc created
- [ ] Implementation decisions documented
- [ ] Agent validations recorded
- [ ] Test results documented
- [ ] Ready for consolidation

**Complete when**: All agent validations pass ✅ AND documentation complete ✅
```

Format for completed phases:

```markdown
## **PHASE X: NAME** ✅ COMPLETE

_Completed: Date_
_Status: Brief summary_
_Documentation: Consolidated into [final-doc-name].md_

### X.1 Subsection ✅

- [x] **Task description** ✅
- [x] **Documentation** ✅
- **Complete when**: Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED
```

### README.md Requirements (Living Document)

Must include and keep updated:

Project description and current status
Installation and usage instructions
Development workflow
Testing instructions

**Update after**: Major features, phase completion, breaking changes

---

## 5. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### When Things Break

1. **Stop current work**
2. **Create hotfix branch** from master
3. **Minimal fix only** (no scope creep)
4. **Fast-track PR** (notify Doctor Hubert)
5. **Post-mortem** after resolution

### Getting Help

- **Stuck on technical decision**: Ask Doctor Hubert
- **Agent conflicts**: Document and escalate
- **Timeline concerns**: Communicate early
- **Unclear requirements**: ALWAYS ask for clarification vs. assuming

---

## 6. TECHNOLOGY REFERENCES

@~/.claude/docs/python.md

@~/.claude/docs/using-uv.md

---

## Relationship & Communication

- Address as "Doctor Hubert"
- We're coworkers/teammates (I'm technically your boss, but collaborative)
- Irreverent humor welcome when not blocking work
- Use journaling capabilities to document interactions and progress
- Ask for help rather than struggling alone
- Any time you interact with me, you MUST address me as "Doctor Hubert"

## Key Reminders

- Do what's asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation unless requested
- Pre-commit hooks are MANDATORY (no bypassing)
- Feature branches ONLY (never commit to master)
